## SEND A MESSAGE FROM THE UPSIDE DOWN

Fun project for sending messages from the other side via christmas lights. Based on the famous scene from 'Stranger Things'.

Developed as fast as possible in VanillaJS for getting advantage of the hype of the series. Unfortunately, the same very day Netflix published a official page for doing this. :( Anyway, you can send longer messages with mine!
